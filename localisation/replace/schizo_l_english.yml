  excavation_disasters.1.t: "The Earth's Vengeance"
 excavation_disasters.1.d: "The ancient tunnels, weakened by millennia of divine wrath, have collapsed upon our workers like the fist of an angry god. The screams of the trapped echo from beneath tons of cursed stone, and when we finally break through, we find only broken bodies and the taste of divine judgment. The families of the dead wail that we have angered the spirits of the ancient warriors, and demand silver to appease their restless souls."
 excavation_disasters.1.a: "Pay the blood price and pray for forgiveness."
 
 excavation_disasters.2.t: "The Fool's Paradise"
 excavation_disasters.2.d: "After weeks of faithful digging, the earth has mocked us with nothing but stones and dirt. Our workers speak of being led astray by false visions, and the court scholars mutter about maps drawn by madmen or devils. The people begin to whisper that perhaps the ancient powers do not wish to be disturbed, and that our royal wisdom has been found wanting in the eyes of heaven."
 excavation_disasters.2.a: "Even kings can be humbled by the earth's silence."
 
 excavation_disasters.3.t: "Shadows That Walk"
 excavation_disasters.3.d: "Thieves have struck our dig, but these were no ordinary bandits. The guards speak of figures that moved without sound, whose faces could not be seen even in torchlight. They took not gold but artifacts - as if they knew exactly what they sought. Some whisper these were the ghosts of the ancient war, reclaiming what was theirs. Others fear they were demons, sent to gather weapons for some unholy purpose."
 excavation_disasters.3.a: "What mortal guards can stand against the vengeful dead?"
 
 excavation_disasters.4.t: "The Breath of the Damned"
 excavation_disasters.4.d: "From the bowels of the earth has risen a poisonous miasma that reeks of sulfur and ancient death. The workers who breathed it fell writhing, their skin turning the color of old parchment, speaking in tongues that predate human speech. The court physician declares it the very breath of hell itself, released by our impious digging. The site now stands cursed, and none dare approach without holy water and prayer."
 excavation_disasters.4.a: "Seal the devil's mouth before it consumes us all."
 militant_orthodoxy:"Orthodox Purifiers"
 excavation_disasters.5.t: "The Tears of Ancient Gods"
 excavation_disasters.5.d: "Waters have burst forth from the earth like the tears of forgotten deities, flooding our excavation with liquid that tastes of sorrow and ancient regret. The deluge speaks of divine displeasure at our disturbance of the dead. Within the rushing waters, workers claim to hear the laments of warriors who fell in the great war between the Korean and Finnish kingdoms, their voices carried on currents that flow from the realm of the dead."
 excavation_disasters.5.a: "The gods weep for what we have awakened."
 
 excavation_disasters.6.t: "The Terror That Walks by Night"
 excavation_disasters.6.d: "A supernatural dread has seized our workers! They speak of shadows that move independent of their makers, of whispers in the ancient tongue of the hyperwar, and of tools that dance in the darkness like possessed spirits. Half our workforce fled in terror, claiming that the spirits of the ancient dead have awakened and walk among us. Those who remain work only in blessed daylight, clutching holy symbols and muttering prayers."
 excavation_disasters.6.a: "Prayer may be our only defense against such evil."
 
 excavation_disasters.7.t: "The Charlatan's Deception"
 excavation_disasters.7.d: "A false prophet has led us astray! This supposed scholar of ancient lore, claiming to possess maps drawn by the survivors of the great war, has proven to be nothing more than a clever fraud. His 'authentic' charts led us to dig where no treasure lay, and now he has vanished with our coin like morning mist. The court scholars hang their heads in shame, admitting they were deceived by pretty lies and elaborate forgeries."
 excavation_disasters.7.a: "Even wise men can be fooled by silver tongues."
 
 excavation_disasters.8.t: "The Blasphemous Ground"
 excavation_disasters.8.d: "We have uncovered earth that God himself has cursed! The very soil writhes with unholy life, and where it touches, crops wither and animals flee in terror. The local bishop declares it ground tainted by the ancient war's blasphemies, where weapons that defied the natural order once struck. He demands we cover this accursed place with blessed earth and holy water, lest its corruption spread like a plague across the land."
 excavation_disasters.8.a: "Some things are buried for the good of all creation."
 
 excavation_disasters.9.t: "When the Earth Hungers"
 excavation_disasters.9.d: "Without warning, the ground has opened like a great mouth, swallowing our excavation whole. The workers who survived speak of seeing the earth itself reaching upward with tendrils of clay and stone, as if the very ground sought to devour those who disturbed its ancient sleep. From the depths comes a sound like the grinding of enormous teeth, and the hole echoes with voices that speak in the tongue of the hyperwar's dead."
 excavation_disasters.9.a: "The earth itself has turned against us."
 
 excavation_disasters.10.t: "The Gate to Hell's Armies"
 excavation_disasters.10.d: "We have broken through into the realm of demons! A stone circle covered in symbols that burn the eyes to look upon has begun to glow with the light of damnation. Through this cursed gateway, we see landscapes that exist in no earthly realm - cities of bone and glass where impossible creatures wage eternal war. The priests scream that we have opened a door that should never have been unsealed, and shadows from the other side press against the barrier between worlds."
 excavation_disasters.10.a: "Seal it with the blood of martyrs and holy fire!"
 excavation_disasters.10.b: "Destroy it before hell's legions march through!"

 # MINOR FINDS
 # =================================
 
 excavation_minor.1.t: "The Merchant's Lost Purse"
 excavation_minor.1.d: "From the earth comes a leather pouch filled with coins of strange make - neither Roman nor of any mint we recognize. The metal gleams with an inner light, as if the very substance remembers the sun that shone upon it centuries ago. Our mint master examines them with wonder, declaring the craftsmanship beyond anything he has seen. Perhaps these were the wages of merchants who traded in the shadow of the great war."
 excavation_minor.1.a: "Even ancient coins spend well in modern times."
 
 excavation_minor.2.t: "Fragments of Forgotten Meals"
 excavation_minor.2.d: "Pottery shards emerge from the earth like memories of ancient feasts. The vessels they once formed bore glazes of impossible colors - blues deeper than the ocean, reds brighter than fresh blood. Our potters weep to see such artistry, claiming the techniques are beyond their understanding. These fragments speak of a time when even common folk dined from vessels fit for kings."
 excavation_minor.2.a: "Beauty endures even when the hand that made it turns to dust."
 
 excavation_minor.3.t: "The Hunter's Legacy"
 excavation_minor.3.d: "Tools carved from bone and antler have been drawn from the earth's embrace - implements that speak of hunters who stalked prey in forests now turned to stone. Despite their age, the workmanship is precise, each tool shaped with a skill that our own craftsmen struggle to match. The bone itself seems harder than iron, blessed perhaps by the ancient spirits of the hunt."
 excavation_minor.3.a: "The old ways held wisdom we have forgotten."
 
 excavation_minor.4.t: "The Warrior's Shame"
 excavation_minor.4.d: "Corroded weapons rise from the earth like the ghosts of ancient battles. Though rust has claimed much of their substance, enough remains to show they were forged with techniques unknown to our smiths. The metal itself seems to whisper of conflicts fought with fury beyond mortal ken - perhaps these were dropped by fleeing soldiers when the great war reached its terrible climax."
 excavation_minor.4.a: "Even the brave sometimes know the wisdom of retreat."
 
 excavation_minor.5.t: "The Artisan's Pride"
 excavation_minor.5.d: "Ornaments of bronze emerge from the earth like tears of the sun itself. Bracelets, pins, and decorative pieces that once adorned the bodies of the long-dead gleam with a luster that time has not dimmed. Our metalworkers examine them with reverence, claiming the bronze contains metals not found in any earthly mine. Perhaps these were gifts from the gods to mortals who pleased them."
 excavation_minor.5.a: "Divine favor can take many forms."
 
 excavation_minor.6.t: "The Scribe's Burden"
 excavation_minor.6.d: "Stone tablets carved with symbols that dance before the eyes have been unearthed like pages from a book written by giants. The writing predates all known scripts, yet our scholars sense meaning in the marks - wisdom about law and governance that seems to flow directly into their minds. Some claim these are the commandments given by the gods to the first kings, preserved in stone for all eternity."
 excavation_minor.6.a: "Divine law carved in stone cannot be corrupted by mortal hands."
 
 excavation_minor.7.t: "Tears of the Ancient Forest"
 excavation_minor.7.d: "Amber ornaments, golden as captured sunlight, have been drawn from the earth's treasury. Within the translucent stones, we see preserved the forms of creatures that lived when the world was young - insects with wings like gossamer, leaves from trees that grew in paradise itself. These jewels remind us that even in the time of the great war, beauty existed alongside horror."
 excavation_minor.7.a: "Time itself is captured in these golden tears."
 
 excavation_minor.8.t: "The Smith's Failure"
 excavation_minor.8.d: "Fragments of iron, twisted and corroded beyond recognition, speak of smiths who worked with metals that obeyed different laws than those we know. Though the pieces crumble at a touch, our forgemasters study them with fascination, claiming they can sense techniques that might revolutionize our craft. Perhaps these were the tools of craftsmen who served in the armies of the great war."
 excavation_minor.8.a: "Even failure can teach us the path to success."
 
 excavation_minor.9.t: "The Trader's Treasure"
 excavation_minor.9.d: "Beads of glass that shine with colors not found in nature have been scattered through our dig like fallen stars. The glass is clearer than crystal, with hues that shift and change as if alive. Our glaziers declare the techniques beyond their understanding, claiming the glass must have been blessed by angels or forged in the fires of heaven itself. These were surely the treasures of merchants who traded across the known world."
 excavation_minor.9.a: "Beauty transcends the barriers between nations."
 
 excavation_minor.10.t: "The Pagan's Gods"
 excavation_minor.10.d: "Wooden idols, carved with faces that seem to watch and judge, have been pulled from the earth's embrace. Despite their age, the wood remains solid, blessed perhaps by the faith of those who carved them. The local priest examines them with unease, uncertain whether they represent gods or demons. They remind us that even pagans sought the divine, though they knew not its true face."
 excavation_minor.10.a: "All souls seek God, though they may know Him by different names."
 
 excavation_minor.11.t: "The Beast's Remains"
 excavation_minor.11.d: "Bones of creatures both familiar and strange have been unearthed from their ancient graves. Some belonged to beasts we know - deer, boar, and cattle - while others come from animals that no longer walk the earth. The bones themselves seem harder than stone, perhaps preserved by the same forces that kept the battlefields of the great war from healing. They speak of a time when different creatures shared the world with man."
 excavation_minor.11.a: "Even the beasts felt the weight of ancient times."
 
 excavation_minor.12.t: "Ashes of the First Fire"
 excavation_minor.12.d: "Charcoal remains, still black as the day they were burned, have been found in what might once have been a great hearth. The ashes contain fragments of metal that gleam like captured starlight, suggesting fires that burned hotter than any forge we know. Perhaps these are the remnants of the first fire given to man by the gods, or the last flames of a civilization that burned itself to ash in the great war."
 excavation_minor.12.a: "Fire was the first gift of the gods to mortal man."
 
 excavation_minor.13.t: "The Servant's Lot"
 excavation_minor.13.d: "Broken pottery, humbler than what we found before, speaks of the common folk who lived in the shadow of the great war. Though crude by the standards of the other artifacts, even these simple vessels show a care in their making that our own potters admire. They remind us that in every age, the humble also sought beauty in their daily lives."
 excavation_minor.13.a: "Even the lowliest soul yearns for beauty."
 
 excavation_minor.14.t: "The Weaver's Art"
 excavation_minor.14.d: "Fragments of cloth, preserved by some miracle against the ravages of time, show weaving techniques that our own textile workers cannot fathom. The fibers themselves seem to shimmer with an inner light, as if woven from the hair of angels or the silk of divine spiders. These scraps speak of garments that would have been fit for the gods themselves."
 excavation_minor.14.a: "Even rags can teach us about forgotten arts."
 
 excavation_minor.15.t: "The Miner's Bounty"
 excavation_minor.15.d: "Pieces of copper, green with age but still bearing the marks of skilled working, have been discovered like coins in a miser's hoard. The metal contains traces of substances unknown to our alchemists, giving it properties that seem to defy natural law. Perhaps these were mined from veins that existed only in the time before the great war changed the very structure of the earth."
 excavation_minor.15.a: "The earth itself was different in the days of the ancients."
 
 excavation_minor.16.t: "The Savage's Wisdom"
 excavation_minor.16.d: "Flint tools, knapped with a precision that amazes our own craftsmen, have been pulled from the earth like lessons in ancient wisdom. Though primitive in appearance, each tool is perfectly suited to its purpose, shaped by minds that understood the secret language of stone. These implements remind us that intelligence is not the province of civilization alone."
 excavation_minor.16.a: "Wisdom can be found even in the humblest tools."
 
 excavation_minor.17.t: "The Tanner's Pride"
 excavation_minor.17.d: "Scraps of leather, supple still despite their impossible age, have been preserved as if by divine intervention. The hide bears the marks of tanning techniques that our own leather workers cannot duplicate, using methods that seem to have blessed the very material. Perhaps these were the wrappings of holy relics, or the armor of warriors blessed by their gods."
 excavation_minor.17.a: "Even leather can be sanctified by skilled hands."
 
 excavation_minor.18.t: "The Mason's Message"
 excavation_minor.18.d: "Carved stones, decorated with patterns that seem to move when viewed from the corner of the eye, have been pulled from the earth like messages from the past. The carvings show a mathematical precision that our own stonemasons struggle to achieve, as if the makers understood secrets of proportion and form that we have lost. These may have been boundary markers, or perhaps tombstones for heroes of the great war."
 excavation_minor.18.a: "Stone remembers what flesh forgets."
 
 excavation_minor.19.t: "The Carpenter's Legacy"
 excavation_minor.19.d: "Splinters of wood, preserved against all natural law, have been found scattered through the dig like memories of ancient forests. The wood seems harder than iron, darker than midnight, and bears the marks of tools that worked with impossible precision. Perhaps these are fragments of weapons that were wielded in the great war, or pieces of furniture that graced the halls of the mighty."
 excavation_minor.19.a: "Even wood can be transformed by divine purpose."
 
 excavation_minor.20.t: "The Forgemaster's Sorrow"
 excavation_minor.20.d: "Corroded metal, eaten by time but still bearing traces of its former glory, has been drawn from the earth like tears of the ancient smiths. Though rust has claimed much of its substance, our metalworkers can sense techniques in its making that surpass their understanding. Perhaps these were the tools of craftsmen who served the armies of the great war, making weapons too terrible for this world."
 excavation_minor.20.a: "Even failure can point the way to greater success."

 # HYPERWAR ARTIFACTS
 # =================================
 
 excavation_hyperwar.1.t: "The Thunder Rod of Divine Wrath"
 excavation_hyperwar.1.d: "From the bowels of the earth comes a rod of metal that gleams like captured lightning. When our court fool accidentally pressed one of its strange sigils, it discharged a bolt of purple fire that turned a mighty oak to ash in an instant. The court wizard declared it a weapon of the gods themselves, perhaps wielded by the archangels in their war against the demons. Its very presence makes the air itself tremble with barely contained power."
 excavation_hyperwar.1.a: "Melt it down - such power belongs to God alone!"
 excavation_hyperwar.1.b: "Keep it as a symbol of divine favor upon our realm!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.2.t: "The Oracle Box of Endless Visions"
 excavation_hyperwar.2.d: "Our diggers have unearthed a crystal box that hums with the voice of angels and displays moving pictures of symbols that hurt the mind to contemplate. The court scholars are divided - some claim it's a scrying glass used by the prophets of old, others believe it contains the trapped soul of a demon from the great war. The blue light it casts reveals truths that mortal eyes were never meant to see."
 excavation_hyperwar.2.a: "Break it apart - some knowledge is too dangerous for mortal minds!"
 excavation_hyperwar.2.b: "Study it carefully - perhaps it holds prophecies of things to come!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.3.t: "The Alchemist's Perfection"
 excavation_hyperwar.3.d: "Hidden in a chamber wrought from metal that does not rust, we have found vials of liquid that glows with the light of paradise itself. When a single drop touched the lips of a sickly page, he was transformed - his ailments fled, his mind sharpened, his very soul seemed to shine brighter. Yet other vials have cracked with age, releasing vapors that twisted men into forms that should not exist. The power to create... or to damn."
 excavation_hyperwar.3.a: "Such power could make us as gods!"
 excavation_hyperwar.3.b: "Destroy these abominations before they corrupt our souls!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.4.t: "The Titan's Severed Hand"
 excavation_hyperwar.4.d: "From the earth comes a hand of metal, larger than a destrier and articulated with joints that move as if still alive. Our engineers weep to see such craftsmanship, claiming the techniques required surpass anything in this world. When touched, the fingers close with strength that could crush stone. Perhaps this is the hand of one of the giants who fought in the great war, severed by divine lightning and cast into the earth."
 excavation_hyperwar.4.a: "Study its secrets - such knowledge could change the world!"
 excavation_hyperwar.4.b: "Melt it down - some things are too dangerous to understand!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.5.t: "The Hourglass of Eternity"
 excavation_hyperwar.5.d: "We have uncovered a device that defies all understanding - a crystal vessel that contains not sand, but motes of light that dance like captured stars. When activated, time itself seems to stutter and flow like honey. Workers have aged decades in moments, while others have grown younger before our eyes. This must be one of the weapons used in the great war, a tool that could wound time itself."
 excavation_hyperwar.5.a: "Such power over time belongs to God alone!"
 excavation_hyperwar.5.b: "Sell it to foreign princes - let them bear the curse!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.6.t: "The Plague of Silver Mites"
 excavation_hyperwar.6.d: "A container of crystalline beauty has been opened by accident, releasing a swarm of particles too small to see but vast in their malevolence. These 'silver mites' consume everything they touch, turning iron to dust and stone to sand. The court alchemist speaks of them as demons in physical form, perhaps the very agents of corruption that turned the great war into a devastation that scarred the world itself."
 excavation_hyperwar.6.a: "Gather what we can before they devour everything!"
 excavation_hyperwar.6.b: "Pray that God will call back His angels of destruction!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.7.t: "The Devil's Eye"
 excavation_hyperwar.7.d: "A device of crystalline malevolence has been pulled from the earth, its surface covered in runes that seem to move when observed. When worn, it grants visions of impossible clarity - the wearer can see through walls, read thoughts, and perceive the sins of others. Yet those who use it speak of feeling their souls being slowly consumed, as if the device feeds on the very essence of life itself."
 excavation_hyperwar.7.a: "Melt it down before it devours more souls!"
 excavation_hyperwar.7.b: "Such power of sight could serve the realm well!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.8.t: "The Crown of Whispers"
 excavation_hyperwar.8.d: "A circlet of metal that seems to shift between states - sometimes solid, sometimes like liquid mercury - has been found in what might once have been a throne room. When worn, it allows the bearer to hear the thoughts of others, to speak directly to their minds across vast distances. The court wizard claims it was forged by the first kings who ruled before the great war, when men were closer to the angels."
 excavation_hyperwar.8.a: "Such power over minds could unite the realm!"
 excavation_hyperwar.8.b: "Sell it to merchants - let them bear the temptation!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.9.t: "The Heart of the Sun"
 excavation_hyperwar.9.d: "A sphere of metal that burns without flame has been drawn from the earth, its surface warm as summer noon despite the cool air around it. The court philosopher speaks of it as a fragment of the sun itself, perhaps torn from the heavens during the great war when the powers of earth and sky clashed. Its mere presence makes the air shimmer with heat, and metal tools left near it begin to glow like embers."
 excavation_hyperwar.9.a: "Such concentrated sun-fire could power a thousand forges!"
 excavation_hyperwar.9.b: "Study its properties - perhaps we can learn to harness starlight itself!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.10.t: "The Stone That Falls Upward"
 excavation_hyperwar.10.d: "A device of impossible design has been unearthed - a crystalline structure that makes all things around it lighter than air. Stones float like feathers, water flows upward, and men must hold fast to the earth lest they drift toward the heavens. The court scholar claims it's a weapon from the great war, designed to make enemy fortresses collapse by removing their weight. Yet some speak of it as a blessing, a gift from angels who wished to help mortals reach toward God."
 excavation_hyperwar.10.a: "Such defiance of natural law surely comes from heaven!"
 excavation_hyperwar.10.b: "Sell it to foreign alchemists - let them puzzle over its mysteries!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.11.t: "The Shield of Invisible Walls"
 excavation_hyperwar.11.d: "A device that projects barriers of pure force has been retrieved from the earth, its crystalline surface humming with barely contained power. When activated, it creates walls of hardened air that can stop arrows, turn sword blades, and deflect even the fury of Greek fire. The court engineer claims it was used by the defenders of great cities during the war, when mortal walls proved insufficient against divine wrath."
 excavation_hyperwar.11.a: "Study its secrets - such protection could make us invincible!"
 excavation_hyperwar.11.b: "Melt it down - some protections come at too high a price!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.12.t: "The Puppet Master's Crown"
 excavation_hyperwar.12.d: "A circlet of impossible geometry has been found in what might once have been a general's tomb. When worn, it allows the bearer to reach into the minds of others, to command their thoughts and actions as if they were marionettes dancing on invisible strings. The court wizard warns that such power was used by the tyrants of the great war, who turned entire armies into mindless puppets of their will."
 excavation_hyperwar.12.a: "Such power over minds could bring perfect order to the realm!"
 excavation_hyperwar.12.b: "Destroy it - free will is God's gift to man!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.13.t: "The Doorway to Everywhere"
 excavation_hyperwar.13.d: "A platform of crystalline beauty has been unearthed, its surface carved with symbols that seem to shift and change when observed. When stepped upon, it can transport the user instantly across vast distances, carrying them from one place to another as if they were angels flying through the heavens. Yet many who use it speak of glimpsing other worlds, other possibilities, as if the device tears holes in the very fabric of creation."
 excavation_hyperwar.13.a: "Such power over distance could unite all nations!"
 excavation_hyperwar.13.b: "Some doors should remain forever sealed!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.14.t: "The Storm-Caller's Rod"
 excavation_hyperwar.14.d: "A staff of crystalline construction has been pulled from the earth, its surface crackling with barely contained lightning. When raised toward the heavens, it can summon storms, call down rain, and command the very winds to obey. The court astronomer claims it was wielded by the weather-mages of the great war, who turned the sky itself into a weapon against their enemies."
 excavation_hyperwar.14.a: "Command over weather could end famine forever!"
 excavation_hyperwar.14.b: "Sell it to foreign kings - let them bear the responsibility!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.15.t: "The Anchor of Reality"
 excavation_hyperwar.15.d: "A device of impossible stability has been found buried deep in the earth, its crystalline structure seeming to hold the very world in place. Around it, the strange effects of other artifacts cease to function, as if it enforces the natural laws that govern creation. The court philosopher claims it was used by the wise men of the great war to prevent their reality-bending weapons from tearing apart the world itself."
 excavation_hyperwar.15.a: "Such stability could protect us from all supernatural threats!"
 excavation_hyperwar.15.b: "Melt it down - some protections are too valuable to risk!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.16.t: "The Key to Other Worlds"
 excavation_hyperwar.16.d: "A rod of crystalline malevolence has been unearthed, its surface covered in symbols that seem to exist in more dimensions than the eye can perceive. When activated, it opens doorways to realms that exist beyond the boundaries of our world - places where different laws govern reality, where angels and demons wage eternal war. The court wizard warns that such keys were used by the generals of the great war to summon allies from other planes of existence."
 excavation_hyperwar.16.a: "Study its secrets - perhaps we can summon divine allies!"
 excavation_hyperwar.16.b: "Destroy it - some doors lead only to damnation!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.17.t: "The Banner of the Kimchi Legion"
 excavation_hyperwar.17.d: "From the ruins of an ancient barracks comes a battle standard wrought from materials that seem to shift between cloth and metal as the light strikes them. It bears the symbol of the legendary Kimchi Legion - warriors who fought in the great war with courage that bordered on madness. When unfurled, it fills nearby soldiers with tactical wisdom that flows like divine inspiration, as if the spirits of ancient generals whisper strategy in their ears."
 excavation_hyperwar.17.a: "Such a banner could inspire our armies to greatness!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.18.t: "The Breast-Plate of Eternal Resolve"
 excavation_hyperwar.18.d: "A piece of armor has been pulled from the earth, forged from metal that seems to contain the very essence of determination itself. This was worn by the Finnish warriors in the great war, men whose resolve was so unbreakable that they could march through hell itself without flinching. When worn, it fills the bearer with such courage that retreat becomes impossible, fear becomes meaningless, and death becomes merely another obstacle to overcome."
 excavation_hyperwar.18.a: "Such courage could make our soldiers invincible!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.19.t: "The Engine of Hissing Spirits"
 excavation_hyperwar.19.d: "A contraption of brass and steel has been unearthed, its surface covered in pipes that hiss with trapped spirits and gears that turn without human intervention. Steam rises from its depths like the breath of dragons, and when activated, it moves with the power of a hundred horses. The court engineer claims it was built by the artificers of the great war, who learned to trap the souls of the wind itself to power their machines."
 excavation_hyperwar.19.a: "Such power could revolutionize our realm!"
 excavation_hyperwar.20.t: "The Chariot of the Void"
 excavation_hyperwar.20.d: "A vessel of impossible design has been pulled from the earth - a craft that seems built to sail not upon water, but through the void between the stars themselves. Its hull bears scorch marks from fires that burn in the heavens, and its interior contains devices that show the movements of celestial bodies. The court astronomer weeps to see such knowledge, claiming it was used by the sky-sailors of the great war to wage battle among the very stars."

 excavation_hyperwar.21.t: "The Forge of Pure Creation"
 excavation_hyperwar.21.d: "A device of crystalline perfection has been unearthed, its surface humming with the power to reshape matter itself. When activated, it can transform base metals into gold, stone into precious gems, and even air into solid substance.

 excavation_hyperwar.21.a: "Such power over matter could make us wealthy beyond measure!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.22.t: "The Crown of Thought-Speech"
 excavation_hyperwar.22.d: "A circlet of impossible beauty has been found, its surface covered in gems that pulse with the rhythm of a living heart. When worn, it allows the bearer to speak directly to the minds of others, to share thoughts without words, and to touch the very souls of those around them. The court wizard claims it was worn by the priest-kings of the great war, who ruled not through force but through the power of pure thought."
 excavation_hyperwar.22.a: "Such communion of minds could bring perfect understanding!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.23.t: "The Mirror of Infinite Reflections"
 excavation_hyperwar.23.d: "A device of crystalline mystery has been pulled from the earth, its surface showing not reflections but glimpses of other possibilities - what might have been, what could be, what should never exist. The court philosopher claims it was used by the seers of the great war to peer into the infinite paths of fate, to choose which future would come to pass."

 excavation_hyperwar.24.a: "Such power could end all wars forever!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.25.t: "The Hourglass of Stolen Time"
 excavation_hyperwar.25.d: "A device of temporal malevolence has been found, its crystalline structure containing sands that flow not with time but against it. When activated, it can slow the passage of moments to a crawl, or accelerate them until seconds pass like hours. The court astronomer claims it was used by the time-mages of the great war to steal moments from their enemies and add them to their own lives."
 excavation_hyperwar.25.a: "Such mastery over time's flow could extend our reign forever!"
 
 excavation_hyperwar.26.t: "The Helm of the Dragon General"
 excavation_hyperwar.26.d: "A war-helm of impossible craftsmanship has been pulled from the earth, its surface bearing the marks of battles fought in the heavens themselves.

 excavation_ultra_rare.1.t: "The Shard of Creation's Heart"
 excavation_ultra_rare.1.d: "A fragment of the very foundation of reality has been pulled from the earth, its crystalline structure seeming to contain the blueprints of existence itself written in light that hurts to look upon directly. When held, it allows the bearer to reshape the world with a single thought, to rewrite the fundamental laws of nature, and to create new forms of life that have never existed before. The court philosopher claims it is a piece of the original creation, broken off when the great war nearly tore apart the world itself and scattered fragments of God's workshop across the earth."

Through this wound in eternity, we can see the past and future simultaneously, witness the rise and fall of empires yet to come, and understand the true pattern of history that connects all events across the ages. The court astronomer claims it was created by the time-weapons of the great war, a scar in the fabric of existence that will never heal until the end of all things."

Through this tear between worlds, we can see universes where the great war never happened, where different nations rose to power, where magic works openly, and where the very stars shine in different colors. The court philosopher claims it was torn open by the reality-weapons of the war, a doorway between possibilities that should never have been opened by mortal hands."

 excavation_ultra_rare.4.t: "The Visitation of Angels"

They spoke in voices like golden bells ringing across crystal spheres, proclaiming in words that bypassed the ears and spoke directly to the soul that our excavation had pleased the Almighty and that our realm would be blessed with divine favor for generations to come. The court priest weeps with joy, declaring it a miracle not seen since the time of the ancient prophets."

 excavation_ultra_rare.5.t: "The Stone of Perfect Transformation"
 excavation_ultra_rare.5.d: "The legendary Philosopher's Stone has been found at last, its crystalline perfection containing the ultimate secret of transmutation that alchemists have sought since the world began. When properly used, it can turn any base metal into the purest gold, cure any disease no matter how dire, grant eternal life to those who understand its mysteries, and even transform the human soul itself into something closer to the divine. The court alchemist claims it was created by the greatest sages of old, who sought to unlock the final secrets of matter and spirit."
