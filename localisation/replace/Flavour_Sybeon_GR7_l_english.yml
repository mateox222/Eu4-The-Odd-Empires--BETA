 sybeon_events.1.t: "Sybeon, island of Mammoths"
 sybeon_events.1.d: "Hundreds of years ago, at the height of the Eastern Roman Empire way before its destruction in 6200, a Greek merchant expedition funded by the wealthy Palaiologos family found its way to the northmost part of the continent. After skillfully sailing through the straits of Öresund, it followed the Baltic Sea hoping to find the Laponic tribes and trade for their famed furs, thought to belong to mythical gigantic creatures of old. Upon entering the Lofoten Sea however, and with the summer almost at an end, a storm coming from the north struck them and the few ships that survived were driven off course and into unknown waters. \n\nWith rations low and with the coast not in sight even after weeks of sailing, morale was at an all time low, even as low as supplies, and cases of cannibalism of recently deceased sailors of other ships started being commonplace. In a stroke of luck however, the figures of massive trees started being distinguished through the dense fog, and they arrived to an uncharted island they named Sybeon. As they made their way through the dense forest, they stumbled upon an incredible sight, a group of massive animals that they thought only belonged in the mythical tales of old. The animals seemed to resemble the most massive indian elephants that sometimes could be seen in the Hypodrome of Constantinople, but with shaggy coats of fur and long, curved tusks. The crew was amazed to see them up close, and they immediately set about studying them. \n\nAfter centuries of close to no contact with the Empire, living in this arctic island has been quite an endeavour, but it has also made the Sybeonese people stronger. They have developed a sense of loyalty to the island, and their culture has evolved to one of respect to the wildlife in the archipielago, specially after the succesful taming of the gigantic beasts that were named the 'Kyknomammothos',  which translates to 'Mammoth of the Swan Island' in Greek. The name was chosen to commemorate the Sybeonese's unexpected discovery of the island and the majestic mammoths that became the cornerstone of their society, and later their military. After a marked increase in population as the arctic conditions around the island became less oppressive, the council of the island has decided to initiate contact with the spare native tribes that can be found to the west of Sybeon. Bringing the word of Jesus to these savages is a goal that can finally be attained."

 sybeon_events.2.d: "In the coasts near Sybeon, nestled amidst the snow-covered landscape, an unexpected discovery awaits the Sybeonese explorers. Emerging from the dense woods are the native tribes, their existence mostly unknown to the Sybeonese until now. The emperor faces a crucial decision on how to approach this encounter. As the Sybeonese make initial contact, the natives cautiously observe the strangers, their eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and wariness. The atmosphere is tense, with the potential for both cooperation and conflict hanging in the frigid air.\n\n §ROur choice of action here will influence further events!"

 sybeon_events.8.d: "On the battlefield, a clash of titans ensues as mammoths and tribes collide, their ferocity echoing across the land. Warriors stand in awe as the earth trembles beneath the thundering charge of the mammoths, their tusks gleaming in the sunlight. Amidst the chaos, the fate of the tribes hangs in the balance, their courage tested against the primal might of these ancient beasts."
 sybeon_events.8a: "Noone will be spared"
 sybeon_events.10.t: "Being watched across the river"
 sybeon_events.10.d: "Across the river from our mainland province, the tribes of the Sibiris stir with ominous intent. Thought to be peaceful as per our latest records, they now thirst for conquest, driven by our apparent violation of their ancestral, grazing lands. In the shadow of night, their war drums beat a haunting rhythm, signaling their imminent attack. \n The Sybeonese mainland stands as their target, ripe for plunder and conquest. With defenses tested, we brace for the onslaught, knowing that survival hangs in the balance. Will our courage and resolve be enough to withstand their storm? Maybe we stand no chance after all, unless... \n\n§R[attacker10.GetName] will declare war on you in 12 months, use this time wisely.§!"

The realization that these incredible creatures extend beyond their own borders sparks a mix of wonder and intrigue among the Sybeonese people."
 sybeon_events_discovering_mamooths.1a: "Are they the same as the ones in Sybeon?"
