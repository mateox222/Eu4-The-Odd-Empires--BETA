ATLANTROPA_STRUGGLE_DESC:"Northern Europe has always been a wild place, with Celtic, Germanic, and Slavic tribes often attempting to seize southern kingdoms. Eventually, a relatively stable entity emerged to unite the tribes, known as the Hunnic state. However, in recent years, it seems that this state may not withstand the test of time."
ATLANTROPA_PAGANREVENGE_DESC:"The Aztec Empire of Ueyitlan dominated Western Europe for almost 200 years, but in the last decades it weakened significantly, the final blow was the Third Crusade recently announced by the bishop of Rome, whose appeal to the European knighthood was much greater than expected, the largest wave of soldiers since the fall of the Roman Empire sweeps through the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, and the fate of the peninsula is uncertain."
ATLANTROPA_FATEOFEGYPT_DESC: "The fate of Egypt hangs in the balance as it teeters on the brink of a looming civil war, a precipice that leaves all uncertain of what lies ahead. With tensions escalating and divisions deepening, the outcome remains shrouded in ambiguity, casting a cloud of apprehension over the nation's future. In this volatile climate, Egypt's destiny is an enigma, awaiting resolution in the turbulent chapters yet to be written."
ATLANTROPA_BattleAlbion_DESC: "Albion has become the battleground where native kingdoms, the Black Empire of Niflheim, and the Principality of Perpignan clash in epic confrontations.

Amidst the turmoil, alliances shift, strategies evolve, and the fate of Albion hangs in the balance as these formidable forces clash in their pursuit of dominion."
ATLANTROPA_Oblitus_DESC: "Oblitus Terras is a mesmerizing realm where the continents diverge from our own, offering a tapestry of alternate geographies. Within this world, legendary lands like Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria rise from obscurity, captivating the imagination with their enigmatic histories and mystic allure. As continents dance to a different cartographic rhythm, Oblitus Terraz weaves a tale of undiscovered wonders and forgotten civilizations, inviting exploration into the untamed realms of the unknown."
ATLANTROPA_BattleVistula_DESC: "The Vistula region has always been a place of great migrations. First, there were the Huns, then the Germans, and then the Slavs. Currently, there are the Kingdoms of Slavic Wostochieni, Prijov, and Balaton, all of which are competing for dominance in the Vistula region. However, each of them has a different idea how to dominate the region."
ATLANTROPA_LegacySunset_DESC: "Sunset Invasion was a terrible experience that completely changed the political situation in Western Europe. The invading forces, led by the Aztec Empire, struck fear into the hearts of the people as they swept across the land with unprecedented speed and efficiency. The once-great nations of Europe were left reeling and struggling to maintain their sovereignty as they faced the overwhelming power of their new overlords.""
ATLANTROPA_Tigernorth_DESC: "The North Sea, throughout the ages, has been the stage for epic struggles among nations. It has witnessed the rise of new powers, such as Niflheim, Fjordland, Kristaperioa, and the fearless Vikings of Hrothgard. Upon its vast and tempestuous waters, mighty fleets clash, driven by ambition, honor, and a relentless thirst for conquest. The sea becomes a theater of valor and audacity, where the fate of nations is decided through the clash of steel, the unfurling of sails, and the resounding thunder of cannon fire.""
ATLANTROPA_Citydesirre_DESC: "Majestic cities like Constantinople, Rome, and Beijing stand as timeless symbols of power and heritage, awaiting the touch of ambitious conquerors to shape their destinies anew. Constantinople's ancient walls hold the echoes of empires, while Rome's grandeur whispers tales of unmatched legacy. As for Beijing, its imperial splendor conceals untold opportunities for those who dare to reach out and seize the reins of history."

 silver: "Silver" #Name
 silverDESC: "Silver was one of the seven metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history. In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering.[57] However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold." #Description
 beer: "Beer" #Name

The third most popular drink overall after water and tea - it is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent."
