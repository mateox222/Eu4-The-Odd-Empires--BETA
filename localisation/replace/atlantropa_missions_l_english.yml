Holding Treviso ensures the safety and prosperity of the Transpadanian heartland. Merano, nestled amidst the towering peaks beyond, strengthens this defensive line, providing a crucial vantage point and denying hostile forces a staging ground for invasion.

It is a dangerous ideology, seductive in its promises of equality and self-determination, yet inherently unstable and prone to factionalism. It undermines the very foundations of our society, threatening the delicate balance of power between the crown, the nobility, and the Church. To combat this insidious threat, the King must act decisively. He must strengthen the institutions that uphold the monarchy, reinforcing the loyalty of the nobility through patronage and privilege, while actively suppressing any republican sentiments through strict censorship and the ruthless persecution of dissidents. He must promote the narrative of a divinely appointed monarch, a shepherd guiding his flock, contrasting it with the chaos and disorder that inevitably follows in the wake of republicanism. He must appeal to the inherent conservatism of the common folk, emphasizing the stability and prosperity enjoyed under his rule. Ultimately, dealing with republicanism requires a delicate balance of carrot and stick - rewarding loyalty while swiftly and mercilessly punishing dissent.

He rewards loyal nobles with lands and titles, solidifying their allegiance and ensuring the stability of the realm. Meanwhile, he carefully dismantles the power bases of potential rivals, through strategic marriages, shrewd appointments, and, when necessary, decisive action against those who threaten his rule. He fosters economic growth by encouraging trade, investing in infrastructure, and standardizing laws and taxes, thus enriching the kingdom and bolstering his treasury. Furthermore, he actively cultivates the image of a wise and just ruler, sponsoring grand public works, patronizing the arts, and skillfully employing propaganda to reinforce his legitimacy. This combination of force, patronage, and public image is methodically weaving a web of power that centralizes authority in the hands of the King, ensuring a stable and prosperous future for Transpadania under his firm control."

Formed from the most skilled and dedicated warriors of the united Manchu tribes, these units are not merely soldiers; they are symbols of Khagan’s power, instruments of his divine mission, and the embodiment of his ambition. The Raise Banners are organized into distinct branches, each specializing in a particular form of warfare. The cavalry archers, mounted on swift, agile horses, are renowned for their accuracy and maneuverability. They rain down arrows upon the enemy, harassing their flanks, disrupting their formations, and sowing confusion before the main assault. The Manchu Chargers, clad in heavy armor, form the backbone of Khagan's shock cavalry. Their devastating charges, often accompanied by the thunderous beat of war drums, break enemy lines and demoralize opponents. These heavily armored warriors, both horse and rider protected by iron lamellar, represent an unstoppable force on the battlefield."

This campaign represents a bold strategic move, offering significant potential rewards but also considerable risks. Khagan’s motivations for this campaign are multifaceted. The Yuan, though weakened, still commands a formidable cavalry force, posing a potential threat to Khagan’s northern border. Conquering them would eliminate this threat and secure access to vast grazing lands, essential for the Manchu horse-based military. Furthermore, subduing the Yuan would bring prestigious legitimacy to Khagan’s rule, linking him to the legacy of Genghis Khan and solidifying his claim to the Mandate of Heaven through the Holy Mandate granted through God, further strengthening his position as a dominant power in the region. He calls this the "Second Yuan", destined to follow Tengri, and the great prophet Jesus instead."

Beijing, the symbolic heart of the new empire, serves as the seat of Khagan’s court. The court’s structure blends Manchu tribal hierarchy with elements borrowed from the Chinese imperial system, creating a unique hybrid that reflects the evolving political landscape. Key positions are filled with loyal members of various Manchu tribes, former Yuan officials who have sworn allegiance to Khagan, and even some high-ranking converts from conquered territories like Joseon and Ming remnants who have been granted nobility and leadership in this changing new order under a Second Yuan under Tengri instead of a new Chinese Jin Dynasty."

No longer solely a site of ancestral worship, it becomes a beacon of Nestorian Christianity, a symbol of the new spiritual era ushered in by the Later Jin Dynasty. The transformation begins with the construction of a grand monastery on the mountain’s slopes. Stone masons, both Manchu and foreign, work tirelessly to create a structure that blends traditional Manchu architecture with elements of Roman and European monastic design. The monastery becomes a hub of religious learning, housing a library filled with sacred texts, attracting scholars and pilgrims from across the empire and beyond."

This vision, however, faces the complex realities of tribal loyalties, cultural traditions, and the inherent challenges of integrating diverse groups under a single banner. Khagan leverages the victories against the crumbling Song Dynasty and the remnants of the Jin to foster a sense of shared purpose and destiny. He portrays these triumphs as divinely ordained, proof of God's favor upon the Manchu people and the righteousness of their cause. This narrative of shared success and divine backing serves as a powerful unifying force, bolstering his authority and strengthening the appeal of Nestorian Christianity."

This chaotic power vacuum presents a golden opportunity for the united Manchu tribes. No longer constrained by the strength of a unified China, they can seize the lands of former tributaries, carving out a new empire in the north. The Raise Banners, Tengri's elite warriors, stand ready to exploit this turmoil. Their swift cavalry archers, ironclad Manchu Chargers, and skilled musketeers can capitalize on the disarray within the Jin ranks, striking quickly and decisively at weakened positions. The Cossack siege engineers offer the means to overcome fortified cities now left vulnerable by the civil war, while the Heavenly Sabers, inspired by Italian tactics, provide a powerful shock troop force capable of shattering disorganized enemy formations. As the Jin Dynasty tears itself apart, Tengri and his devout followers see not only an opportunity for conquest but also a divine calling to bring their Christian faith to the fractured lands, forging a new empire under the banner of the cross amidst the chaos. The chaos provides ample opportunity to infiltrate areas vulnerable and deprived of military presence due to the rebellion. And thus begins the Christian Manchu campaign under Tengri, a leader hungry to claim the northern provinces to begin the foundation of what will soon become a sprawling conquest under his Heavenly Rule."

 aslimgurun_invade_north_desc: "The capture of northern Hebei, the land of the remnants of the Jin Dynasty and home to the strategically vital city of Beijing, is a critical objective for Tengri’s burgeoning Manchu empire. This region, steeped in history and bordering the crumbling Song Dynasty, represents a significant step towards fulfilling his ambition of a new Christian dominion. The Raise Banners are deployed strategically, utilizing their mobility to swiftly traverse the terrain and exploit the instability caused by the remnants of the Jin. Cavalry archers harass enemy outposts, disrupting supply lines and sowing confusion. Meanwhile, Manchu Chargers prepare to deliver the decisive blow, their heavy cavalry poised to smash through weakened defenses. The siege engineers, descendants of Tengri's father's converted Cossacks, now demonstrate their worth. Having studied Beijing’s fortifications, they devise plans to breach the city’s defenses. Using a mix of traditional siege tactics and innovative approaches learned from Europe through missionary contacts, they prepare to overcome the city's resistance. Tengri understands the symbolic importance of Beijing. Its capture would not only secure a vital strategic location but also deliver a powerful message to the warring factions within the Song Dynasty, demonstrating the strength and resolve of the Manchu forces. The Heavenly Sabers, trained in rapid assault tactics, stand ready to exploit any breach in the defenses, leading the charge into the city and securing key points within its walls. The acquisition of Hebei also brings logistical advantages. The fertile lands provide much needed supplies for Tengri’s army, relieving the pressure on the Manchurian heartland and providing a secure base for further expansion. Tengri’s forces aim to offer the remnants of the Jin, broken down nobility of his own people after they faced extinction at the hands of both China and the Mongols, two choices. Integrate, and rejoin their kinsmen to face China in turn with promised lands and wealth if they choose to join. Or extermination if they dare consider defiance when offered salvation. Finally, capturing Beijing would place Tengri’s forces within striking distance of the Song Dynasty's core territories, further destabilizing their rivals and paving the way for the next stage of his divinely inspired conquest."

Now, with the Song Dynasty weakened by internal strife, the dream of breaching this barrier and claiming what lies beyond becomes a tangible possibility. Tengri frames the crossing as a divinely ordained mission, a fulfillment of prophecy. He preaches that God has chosen the Manchu people to bring their Nestorian faith to the misguided masses of China, and the Great Wall is the final obstacle in this sacred quest. The warriors of the Raise Banners see crossing the Wall as a test of their courage and a validation of their martial prowess. It represents the culmination of years of training and preparation, a chance to prove their worth and etch their names into the annals of Manchu history. The older generation, those who remember tales of past defeats and humiliations at the hands of the Chinese, see the crossing as a moment of retribution, an opportunity to avenge past wrongs and assert Manchu dominance."
 mch_christian_empire_title: "Crusade for China"

Khagan, a title evoking the legacy of powerful steppe rulers, blends seamlessly with his fervent Christian faith, creating a unique spiritual and political identity. He envisions a divinely ordained kingdom, a beacon of Nestorian Christianity radiating across the East. His conquests are not mere territorial expansions but divinely mandated crusades, holy wars waged to convert the populace and establish a new Christian order. Beijing, secured as the capital, stands as a monument to Manchu dominance and serves as the center of Khagan’s burgeoning religious authority. Churches rise alongside palaces, the cross a prominent symbol beside traditional Manchu emblems, signifying the fusion of cultures and the centrality of faith within the dynasty. Khagan’s legal system blends Nestorian canon law with Manchu traditions, aiming for a just and righteous society governed by Christian principles, albeit interpreted through his unique cultural lens. Learned scribes, both missionary and Manchu, work to disseminate Nestorian teachings amongst children in newly established academies while also re-educating adults of other faiths who remain neutral towards this new order."

 mch_christianity_east_desc: "Under Khagan's rule, the spread of Nestorian Christianity in the East takes on a unique character, blending with existing Manchu traditions and the political realities of a newly forged empire. It is a faith propagated not just through missionary zeal but also through the power of the state, interwoven with the ambitions of a conquering Khagan. Newly constructed churches dot the landscape, often built alongside traditional Manchu places of worship, reflecting the syncretic nature of this religious transformation. Missionaries, both Western and those trained within the Later Jin Dynasty, travel throughout the newly acquired territories, preaching the gospel in marketplaces, villages, and newly established schools."

 aslimgurun_annex_korea_desc: "The invasion of Joseon, a kingdom nestled on the Korean peninsula, becomes a logical extension of Khagan's ambition to consolidate power and expand the reach of the Later Jin Dynasty. With the northern territories secured and the Manchu tribes increasingly unified under his banner, Khagan turns his gaze eastward, viewing Joseon as a strategic stepping stone towards greater regional dominance. Several factors motivate this invasion. Joseon, a tributary state of the waning Ming Dynasty, represents a potential threat to Khagan’s northern flank. Subduing Joseon would eliminate this threat and secure valuable resources, including manpower and fertile agricultural lands. Additionally, incorporating Joseon into the Later Jin Dynasty would extend Khagan’s reach along the Pacific coastline, providing strategic ports and access to maritime trade routes."
