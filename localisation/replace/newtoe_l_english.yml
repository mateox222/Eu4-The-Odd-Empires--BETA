 desc_hermit_monasticism:0 "The Order of St. Anthony the Great follows the path of the desert fathers, embracing ascetic traditions and seeking God through solitude in remote wilderness areas. Their monasteries are built in mountains, deserts, and isolated regions where monks dedicate their lives to prayer, manual labor, and spiritual purification, following the example of St. Anthony who withdrew to the Egyptian desert."
 
 desc_apostolic_community:0 "The Brotherhood of St. Barnabas seeks to recreate the primitive Christian church as described in the Acts of the Apostles, emphasizing communal ownership, equality among believers, and rejection of hierarchical authority.
