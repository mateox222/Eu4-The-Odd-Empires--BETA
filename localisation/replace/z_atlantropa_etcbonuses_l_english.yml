However, admist the chaos, a prince of the Japanese royal family seems to have escaped, and have taken to staging a guerilla war against us, throughout the country. They, and their supporters, have declared themselves to be the Yokai, and have already formed cells throughout Japan. However, they have been unable to protect the Chrysanthemum Throne, upon which Japanese Emperors have sat since the 7th century.

Whilst we are not sure the cause was the potion, some of our test subjects imbibed with the potion have similarly collapsed, though this was after the Cheonma had already imbibed the potion. All signs seem to point towards the potion being the cause for the Cheonma's death.

Hear the proclamation of the Cheonma! I am the ruler of the Demonic sect, and your only ruler! Asia has been conquered by me. As a result of this, I am now in control of the largest army ever fielded. If anyone dares to resist my supreme authority, they shall know the devastating powers of the Agmajongpa! Those who could challenge my rule no longer exist. Yes, from this day, from this moment forward, the world belongs to me!""

 agmajongpa.23.d:0"We have formed a new order in Japan. The islands have finally succumbed to our rule. The time has come to ensure their integration into the Agmajongpa. This will be done by extreme schooling in matters of theology as well as language. We will ensure a new Japanese culture, the Yogoejoseon, will be born."

The course of Asian history has at last been set back to its natural position, not seen since the times of the Great Hwan."

 agmajongpa.27.d:0"India is vast and diverse, we cannot hope to govern it effectively, let alone integrate it as we did China. We can, however, aim to split the local princes and states against eachother, giving power to those who side with us, and ensuring that the subcontinent is loyal, even if it is never fully integrated into the sect."

 agmajongpa.28.a:0"The Cheonma's will fulfilled."
 agmajongpa.29.t:0"Deadland Wonderland"
 agmajongpa.29.d:0"Our conquests are met with blood and fire. Cities burn, and the lives of a great many of our enemies are extinguished. That is, of course, the norm, in the far North, we are met only with silence and cold, the depths of which seemingly know no bounds. The birth of an isolationist culture in the North has begun, as the frozen wastes block most news from the court in Agmajongpa. Here, a modest life is liveable, if barely, away from the brutality and conquest."
 agmajongpa.29.a:0"A meaningless endeavour?"
# After digging for weeks, the disciples have finally reported success. Inside the tomb, they have unearthed a wide variety of treasures, and no small amount of skeletons. It seems those who dug the tomb were forced into it too, and the doors to the tomb were full of a great many scratch marks. Further into the tomb, we have found a manuscript, that seems to contain the strategies and musings of Genghis!

The war ultimately ended in a stalemate, with the Murim Union, a league of martial artists, coming to control most of Korea, a concession from the ruling Yi dynasty to prevent the complete conquest of Korea by the Agmajongpa. Now, Mount Hwa, and the Namgung Clan have both asserted their autonomy from the Murim Union, whilst the Yi dynasty rules only over a small chunk of land outside of Gyeongbok Palace. Time will tell who will emerge from the war on top, but whatever the case, more blood will be spilt."

 atl_bonusevent.1.t:0"The Last Mammoth Hunt"
 atl_bonusevent.1.d:0"Unlike in other regions of the world, the Vinlandic mammoth lived relatively undisturbed from humans. Prior that is, to the arrival of Norse settlers to the island. However, as of late, the increasing demand for ivory, centered around the city of Vinterfell, have caused the final extinction of the creature on the island. Recently, the last mammoth known to live was hunted down, and it seems the mammoths long existence has finally been ended by humanity."
 atl_bonusevent.1.a:0"Perhaps had we been more conservative..."
 atl_bonusevent.2.t:0"Frischlander Settlers"
 atl_bonusevent.2.d:0"Hundreds of years before our colonization of Frischland, a branch of West-Germans migrated to the island. Though they would mostly die off in the Little Ice Age, it seems more survived than initially thought. They are asking to be granted autonomy and self-rule over the island, calling to our shared heritage. Many amongst our court are calling for their petition to be honored, better to utilize the existing infrastructure and natives who already know the land, rather than wasting our time colonizing the frigid land."
 atl_bonusevent.2.a:0"We will allow them their autonomy."

 atl_bonusevent.5.t:0"The Ways of War"
 atl_bonusevent.5.d:0"Traditionally, warfare in Fryslân has been a small affair. There has hardly been the population required to stage large scale wars. Now however, with the vast population increase brought about by the unification of the island, and the trade with the rest of Europe, our ways of war have come into question. They have been split into two camps, those who think the current way is fine, and a smaller camp who think a Western style reform is in order."

 murimunion.1.t:0"The Stewardship of Korea"
 murimunion.1.d:0"The Murim union was founded as an alliance of orthodox sects of martial artists to fight back the Demonic Cult, under the wish and guidance of the Yi dynasty. We might have driven back the Agmajongpa, but complete victory is not yet assured. Additionally, the Mount Hwa sect has broken free from our control, as has the powerful Namgung family to our south."
 murimunion.1.a:0"We will push on to Agmaui Jali!"
 murimunion.2.t:0"The Fate of Korea"
 murimunion.2.d:0"We have reunified Korea, at the least, we have dealt with the reason for our existence, the Demonic Cult in the North. Now, the question has been broached, what further need is there for the Murim Union? We were founded to fight and end the Agmajongpa. Is it time to return control of Korea to the Yi?"
 murimunion.2.a:0"The age of Murim is over."

 murimunion.4.a:0"Unfortunate that they still breathe."
 murimunion.5.t:0"Talks with Hwasan"
 murimunion.5.d:0"The Mount Hwa sect, or Hwasan, split off from the Murim Union after the Hundred Thousand Sword war, now that they have been integrated into the Murim Union once again, the time has come to induct their sect under Union control oncemore. Now, we oncemore stand united with our Northern brothers against the Demonic threat."

 murimunion.6.t:0"The Execution of the Cheonma"
 murimunion.6.d:0"At last Agmaui Jali stands under our control, if not necessarily our permanent control. We have captured the Cheonma, and order his execution, the foul demon who has for far too long polluted our North is at last dealt with."
 murimunion.6.a:0"Next, the Agmajongpa shall be finished."
 murimunion.7.t:0"The Namgung Clan"
 murimunion.7.d:0"The Namgung Clan, as one of the five great families, is technically subservient to the Murim Union. However, as of late, they have been establishing a power base in the South. This situation should be rectified, either by the reassurance of their membership, or the annexation of their territorial claims back into the Union."
 murimunion.7.a:0"The remnants of their clan will be reintegrated."
 murimunion.7.b:0"We will ask them to rejoin the Union."
 murimunion.8.t:0"Envoys from the Murim Union"
 murimunion.8.d:0"Envoys have reached us from the Murim Union, asking that we put aside our independence and rejoin the Union, to focus on making a better Korea, and finally eliminating the Demonic threat. We are not required to accept their offer, but it is something to consider."
 murimunion.8.a:0"We will rejoin."
 murimunion.8.b:0"The Namgung family will never!"
 murimunion.9.t:0"Hwasan Seized"
 murimunion.9.d:0"After the loss of Hwasan due to intersect tensions, they have oncemore been integrated into the Union oncemore. However, all is not well, and there are certainly those who would see the Hwasan simply rise up again. We must make maneuvers to ensure their reintegration is completed. Until then, the seizure of Mount Hwa will surely help our state's stability."
 murimunion.9.a:0"The righteous duty fulfilled."
 murimunion.10.t:0"Court the Yi"
 murimunion.10.d:0"Our diplomats have prepared a treaty of protection for the court in Gyeonbokgun. This should ensure the Yi are protected and, should we desire it, pliable."
 murimunion.10.a:0"We shall propose it."
 murimunion.11.t:0"Envoys from the Murim Union"
 murimunion.11.d:0"The Murim Union has proposed that we enter under a treaty of protection with them. Whilst this is likely to be a temporary arrangement, with the returnal of our land at the end, there is no telling what the Union might decide to do with Korea."

 #Carthaginian Events
 atl_carthage.1.t:0"The Exile of Carthage"
 atl_carthage.1.d:0"Thousands of years ago, Carthage fell to Rome. Whilst most of the Carthaginians would stay and eventually assimilate into an African-Romance group, our ancestors fled South, and found the great Lake Ahnet. They built a great city, Kartagni Gdida, on a peninsula sticking into the lake. Times were tough, with local Numidian tribes raiding and sacking the city over and over again. However, eventually great walls were constructed, at last providing some reprieve to our people. Now, hundreds of years later, our people barely resemble the old Carthaginians. However, as of late, a new hero has crawled his way to a seat of prominence in Carthagnilda, Hiram Hannibalid. He claims to be a descendant of Hannibal, the hero who once almost saved Carthage. He too vows vengence, and has sworn to see Rome destroyed, and Carthage returned to its rightful position."
 atl_carthage.1.a:0"Carthage shall not be destroyed again. Rome will burn for its sins."
 atl_carthage.2.t:0"The Debate on Mercenaries"
 atl_carthage.2.d:0"The armies of Kartagni Gdida have long been formed of a volunteer citizen force. However, we have recently grown to a size such to allow us to consider other methods of organizing our army. The old Carthaginian army was composed mostly of mercenaries, and there has been a call to return to our traditions. However, there are those who point out that mercenaries failed Carthage in the past, even sacking it! The time has come to decide how to organize our military from now on."
 atl_carthage.2.a:0"There is no Rome to stop us now."
 atl_carthage.2.b:0"They will only fail us again."
 atl_carthage.3.t:0"The Punic Unearthing"
 atl_carthage.3.d:0"We have discovered a community of worshippers of the old faith. These people, located around Porta, worship the ways of the old Carthaginian Empire and Phoenicia. Their ways have rapidly been circulated in Kartagni Gdida, and there are those in our population who desire a return to our old traditions, abandoning the Roman's Christian God. It would require the support of our government to truly reach the level of majority in our cities, however."
 #atl_carthage.3.a:0"§lChrist is not just the God of the Romans.§!"
 atl_carthage.3.b:0"§OThe old teachings of Canaan will guide us!§!"
 atl_carthage.4.t:0"Rebirth of Carthage"
 atl_carthage.4.d:0"Now that Carthage has been reestablished as a local power, the time of the monastic order controlling the city has come to an end, with too much territory to control in our old ways. There are two competing schools of thought, Monarchists, who wish to see Hiram on the throne, should he still live, and the Republicans, who want to see a return to the old Carthaginian Republic."
