However, admist the chaos, a prince of the Japanese royal family seems to have escaped, and have taken to staging a guerilla war against us, throughout the country. They, and their supporters, have declared themselves to be the Yokai, and have already formed cells throughout Japan. However, they have been unable to protect the Chrysanthemum Throne, upon which Japanese Emperors have sat since the 7th century.

Whilst we are not sure the cause was the potion, some of our test subjects imbibed with the potion have similarly collapsed, though this was after the Cheonma had already imbibed the potion. All signs seem to point towards the potion being the cause for the Cheonma's death.

Those who could challenge my rule no longer exist. Yes, from this day, from this moment forward, the world belongs to me!""
 agmajongpa.22.a:0"The Cheonma will soon reign over all."
 agmajongpa.23.t:0"The Sunset Dominion"
 agmajongpa.23.d:0"We have formed a new order in Japan. The islands have finally succumbed to our rule. The time has come to ensure their integration into the Agmajongpa. This will be done by extreme schooling in matters of theology as well as language. We will ensure a new Japanese culture, the Yogoejoseon, will be born."
 agmajongpa.23.a:0"The complete and utter subjugation of all Japanese will soon be completed."
 agmajongpa.24.t:0"Serfs No Longer"
 agmajongpa.24.d:0"No longer shall the Korean nation be a serf to Chinese interests. From now on, the Chinese are to be subject to the demands and interests of the Korean people, and the Agmajongpa. The course of Asian history has at last been set back to its natural position, not seen since the times of the Great Hwan."
 agmajongpa.24.a:0"A good day to be a Korean."
 agmajongpa.25.t:0"The New Way of Life"
 agmajongpa.25.d:0"Now that the Agmajongpa has secured its rule over China, the time has come to begin the process of integrating the Chinese into our traditions. We shall start with the North, and we shall move Southwards with time. Soon, Hangul will be taught in all corners of the world."
 agmajongpa.25.a:0"In due time, all of China will know we are here."
 agmajongpa.26.t:0"Secrets of China"
 agmajongpa.26.d:0"China is broken. From the North in Beijing, to the South in Nanjing, and all in between, the Agmajongpa reigns supreme. We have gained much from this conversion, and we shall ensure that we can take these lessons to heart."
 agmajongpa.26.a:0"Commit the process to text, and secure the records in Agmaui Jali."
 agmajongpa.26.b:0"The Cheonma will devote time to this personally."
 agmajongpa.27.t:0"India Subdued"
 agmajongpa.27.d:0"India is vast and diverse, we cannot hope to govern it effectively, let alone integrate it as we did China. We can, however, aim to split the local princes and states against eachother, giving power to those who side with us, and ensuring that the subcontinent is loyal, even if it is never fully integrated into the sect."
 agmajongpa.27.a:0"We will continue our rule unaltered."
 agmajongpa.27.b:0"We will split the beast into a thousand pieces, never to unite again."
 agmajongpa.28.t:0"Indochina Subdued"
 agmajongpa.28.d:0"Indochina, the frontier of culture between India and China, has been conquered. The region, rich in trade, will surely help our merchants draw wealth from our empire into the core of our nation."
 agmajongpa.28.a:0"The Cheonma's will fulfilled."
 agmajongpa.29.t:0"Deadland Wonderland"
 agmajongpa.29.d:0"Our conquests are met with blood and fire. Cities burn, and the lives of a great many of our enemies are extinguished. That is, of course, the norm, in the far North, we are met only with silence and cold, the depths of which seemingly know no bounds. The birth of an isolationist culture in the North has begun, as the frozen wastes block most news from the court in Agmajongpa. Here, a modest life is liveable, if barely, away from the brutality and conquest."
 agmajongpa.29.a:0"A meaningless endeavour?"
# After digging for weeks, the disciples have finally reported success. Inside the tomb, they have unearthed a wide variety of treasures, and no small amount of skeletons. It seems those who dug the tomb were forced into it too, and the doors to the tomb were full of a great many scratch marks. Further into the tomb, we have found a manuscript, that seems to contain the strategies and musings of Genghis!

The war ultimately ended in a stalemate, with the Murim Union, a league of martial artists, coming to control most of Korea, a concession from the ruling Yi dynasty to prevent the complete conquest of Korea by the Agmajongpa. Now, Mount Hwa, and the Namgung Clan have both asserted their autonomy from the Murim Union, whilst the Yi dynasty rules only over a small chunk of land outside of Gyeongbok Palace. Time will tell who will emerge from the war on top, but whatever the case, more blood will be spilt."

 #Bonus Events
 atl_bonusevent.1.t:0"The Last Mammoth Hunt"
 atl_bonusevent.1.d:0"Unlike in other regions of the world, the Vinlandic mammoth lived relatively undisturbed from humans. Prior that is, to the arrival of Norse settlers to the island. However, as of late, the increasing demand for ivory, centered around the city of Vinterfell, have caused the final extinction of the creature on the island. Recently, the last mammoth known to live was hunted down, and it seems the mammoths long existence has finally been ended by humanity."
 atl_bonusevent.1.a:0"Perhaps had we been more conservative..."
 atl_bonusevent.2.t:0"Frischlander Settlers"
 atl_bonusevent.2.d:0"Hundreds of years before our colonization of Frischland, a branch of West-Germans migrated to the island. Though they would mostly die off in the Little Ice Age, it seems more survived than initially thought. They are asking to be granted autonomy and self-rule over the island, calling to our shared heritage. Many amongst our court are calling for their petition to be honored, better to utilize the existing infrastructure and natives who already know the land, rather than wasting our time colonizing the frigid land."
 atl_bonusevent.2.a:0"We will allow them their autonomy."

 atl_bonusevent.4.a:0"Now more than ever, the Old Ways are strong."
 atl_bonusevent.5.t:0"The Ways of War"
 atl_bonusevent.5.d:0"Traditionally, warfare in Fryslân has been a small affair. There has hardly been the population required to stage large scale wars. Now however, with the vast population increase brought about by the unification of the island, and the trade with the rest of Europe, our ways of war have come into question. They have been split into two camps, those who think the current way is fine, and a smaller camp who think a Western style reform is in order."

 murimunion.1.t:0"The Stewardship of Korea"
 murimunion.1.d:0"The Murim union was founded as an alliance of orthodox sects of martial artists to fight back the Demonic Cult, under the wish and guidance of the Yi dynasty. We might have driven back the Agmajongpa, but complete victory is not yet assured. Additionally, the Mount Hwa sect has broken free from our control, as has the powerful Namgung family to our south."
 murimunion.1.a:0"We will push on to Agmaui Jali!"
 murimunion.2.t:0"The Fate of Korea"
 murimunion.2.d:0"We have reunified Korea, at the least, we have dealt with the reason for our existence, the Demonic Cult in the North. Now, the question has been broached, what further need is there for the Murim Union? We were founded to fight and end the Agmajongpa. Is it time to return control of Korea to the Yi?"
 murimunion.2.a:0"The age of Murim is over."

 murimunion.4.a:0"Unfortunate that they still breathe."
 murimunion.5.t:0"Talks with Hwasan"
 murimunion.5.d:0"The Mount Hwa sect, or Hwasan, split off from the Murim Union after the Hundred Thousand Sword war, now that they have been integrated into the Murim Union once again, the time has come to induct their sect under Union control oncemore. Now, we oncemore stand united with our Northern brothers against the Demonic threat."

 murimunion.6.t:0"The Execution of the Cheonma"
 murimunion.6.d:0"At last Agmaui Jali stands under our control, if not necessarily our permanent control. We have captured the Cheonma, and order his execution, the foul demon who has for far too long polluted our North is at last dealt with."
 murimunion.6.a:0"Next, the Agmajongpa shall be finished."
 murimunion.7.t:0"The Namgung Clan"
 murimunion.7.d:0"The Namgung Clan, as one of the five great families, is technically subservient to the Murim Union. However, as of late, they have been establishing a power base in the South. This situation should be rectified, either by the reassurance of their membership, or the annexation of their territorial claims back into the Union."

 murimunion.7.b:0"We will ask them to rejoin the Union."
 murimunion.8.t:0"Envoys from the Murim Union"
 murimunion.8.d:0"Envoys have reached us from the Murim Union, asking that we put aside our independence and rejoin the Union, to focus on making a better Korea, and finally eliminating the Demonic threat. We are not required to accept their offer, but it is something to consider."
 murimunion.8.a:0"We will rejoin."
 murimunion.8.b:0"The Namgung family will never!"
 murimunion.9.t:0"Hwasan Seized"
 murimunion.9.d:0"After the loss of Hwasan due to intersect tensions, they have oncemore been integrated into the Union oncemore. However, all is not well, and there are certainly those who would see the Hwasan simply rise up again. We must make maneuvers to ensure their reintegration is completed. Until then, the seizure of Mount Hwa will surely help our state's stability."
 murimunion.9.a:0"The righteous duty fulfilled."
 murimunion.10.t:0"Court the Yi"
 murimunion.10.d:0"Our diplomats have prepared a treaty of protection for the court in Gyeonbokgun. This should ensure the Yi are protected and, should we desire it, pliable."
 murimunion.10.a:0"We shall propose it."
 murimunion.11.t:0"Envoys from the Murim Union"
 murimunion.11.d:0"The Murim Union has proposed that we enter under a treaty of protection with them. Whilst this is likely to be a temporary arrangement, with the returnal of our land at the end, there is no telling what the Union might decide to do with Korea."
