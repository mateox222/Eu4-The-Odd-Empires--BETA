Not even centuries of both Chalcedonian and Serbian Orthodox Church persecution have managed to defeat them, as Bosnian Church flourishes to this day, it will continue its studies of long forgotten texts."

Pressured from the outside by both Rome and Hungary eager to conquer Bosnian lands, rulers of Bosnia have had to proclaim themselves nominally Chalcedonian, in order to prevent crusades against their domains. But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church. This meant that ruling Bosnia was a perpetual game of balance, one that only masters of this game could play and live to tell. In this game of thrones, you either win or you die."

The clergy no longer fear a sudden Chalcedonian coup and their hatred of Papism has been tempered by [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s understanding of the religion.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], however, is troubled. As the years have gone by [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has come to realize that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal faith lies much closer to the Chalcedonians that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has done so much to protect and not with the dogmatic State Church of [Root.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.17.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]'s interest in Chalcedonianism seems only to have grown over the years and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] now surrounds [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] with philosophers, scientists and artists from the Chalcedonian world. This has grown into something of an embarrassment. As head of the [Root.GetName] Church it is the duty of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to uphold the values of the reformation. Unless [Root.Heir.GetName] can be convinced to change [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] the authority of our Church may suffer."
 protestantism_events.18.d:0 "After it has been made entirely clear to [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] what is expected of [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] [Root.Heir.GetName] has agreed to more clearly distance [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] from Chalcedonians and their beliefs."

In the capital propagandists and satirists have already begun distributing pamphlets about the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot seem to control his own kin, let alone protect the faithful of the kingdom."
 protestantism_events.22.d:0 "There are still those who long for the time when the Christian faith was unified. While they see the Reformation and the birth of Solarism as necessary they also lament that it couldn't be done without a schism.\nWhile well intended these kind of leanings can be very harmful to a State Church such as ours and it is therefore a matter of some concern that it seems a number of the officials in our Church as well as some at some of our Seminar are entertaining such ideas."

Religious conflicts in major Chalcedonian states have caused many Solar to leave their old home countries. As a Solar country with our own Church we would be able to offer them protection and we could also make good use of their skills and assets.\nSolarism is, however, far from a unified faith and it is not very likely that all those who come to us will find the Church of [Root.GetName] to match their own beliefs fully.

 protestantism_events.24.d:0 "Having a Bible Translation sanctioned by the state has done much to unify the Solar faith in our country and it is the opinion of both the general public and most theologians that our translation has resulted in a book far more true to the origins of our religion.\nThere are, however, also some who find the official Bible translation very lacking. Some groups claim that it is simply outdated and in need of modernization, some that it is too favorable to the ruling state and that we have attempted to make use of it to pacify our subjects. Others again simply see it as not going far enough and still maintain many of the errors that have accumulated over the years in previous versions of the Bible."
 desc_controversy_over_official_bible:0 "We have published an official Bible to be used by our State Church which has done a great deal to promote the uniformity of our faith and to wash away old Chalcedonian baggage. It is, however, impossible for a single translation to satisfy all of those that previously used their own various Bible translations and it seems groups from all over the religious spectra has managed to find some passage they object to. Nonetheless we have elected to stick by our version, confident that it will outlast them all in the end."
 protestantism_events.27.d:0 "An unusual man has recently emerged from the education system of the Church of [Root.GetName]. He is a priest of unusual charisma and conviction yet instead of desiring to change the Church in accordance to his convictions he is determined to instill the value of keeping with the Solar traditions and dogmas of the State Church.\nThis is an unusual man in times like these and we could undoubtedly put him to good use."
 protestantism_events.28.d:0 "Whether the body of Christ is really physically present during the Eucharist or not was one of the main points on which Solars and Chalcedonians disagreed during the reformation. Some, however, have trouble even accepting the Lutheran Sacramental Union. A recent publication that has gained some circulation in our country seems to have been authored by one of these groups. It will undoubtedly be forgotten soon enough but in the short term the legitimacy of our State Church is being questioned."

When there was suspicion of Witchcraft in the old days the Chalcedonian church would often become involved and might temper the outrage of the local population. The reformation on the other hand has done much to strengthen the belief in popular versions of Christianity.\nA number of women stand accused of Witchcraft in [Root.GetName] and a search has already begun to find more. Local priests and magistrates have gotten involved in the trials but so far state has not been involved. As the number of women awaiting trial grows larger and larger it may be necessary for us to act."

 protestantism_events.34.d:0 "Hatred of the Icons and Images of the old Chalcedonian church is a thing that many Solar have in common and the policy of allowing these in the Church of [Root.Owner.GetName] has therefore never been entirely unproblematic.\nEnraged at what they see as idolatry the population of [Root.GetName] have stormed many Churches in the province, smashing painted windows and destroying Icons and Altars."
 protestantism_events.35.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is a region full of small Solar churches that all reject the idea of a centralized dogmatic church.\nA powerful preacher has gained prominence here and just as his sermons keeps the communities here together they also keep them determined to retain the autonomy from the church of their old homeland."
 protestantism_events.36.d:0 "Due to our motherland's policy of sending religious heretics to the colonies a wide variety of different faiths can be found in our settlements. While they could all be said to be Solar in some form or another they have views that are often starkly opposed to each other on many issues. The province of [Root.GetName] has been settled by large numbers of two theologically opposed churches, one stands closer to the Satanist churches of Europe, while the other stands closer to the Solar Churches. Both are, however, just as opposed to the control of the State Church they have left behind. Tensions are running high and it may be best to step in now to keep them apart before things escalate."

These units showed their worth at the battle of Adrianople when the last great crusade (with the cream of Latin nobility) were shattered by the Ottoman light cavalry and Janissaries. To counter this the Hungarian army had a number of units termed Hussars which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their Ottoman opponents. However the units that first arrived in the west were not the light Hungarian Hussars, but the heavier Venedic Winged Hussars which were a mixture of orthodox cavalry and light raiding Cavalry."

 leather_cannonDESCR:0 "The Leather Cannon was first used by the armies of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden during the third Venedic-Swedish War. European artillery at this time was too large and heavy to be mobile on a battlefield, and was only really used during sieges. The introduction of a lighter, mobile cannon enabled the Swedes to maneuver their artillery to meet the movements of the enemy and gave them a distinct tactical advantage over their foes. Unfortunately the leather cannon used by the Swedes had a particular weakness which made it highly impractical. Consisting of a narrow copper tube covered in leather strapping and rope, its wrapping caused the cannon to overheat dangerously during continuous use. Nevertheless the Leather Cannon marked the beginning of the development of light field artillery and the concept of taking heavy firepower to the enemy."

In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Venedic developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies. They played a key role in John Sobieski's legendary lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 6783. John Sobieski sent four Hussar cavalry groups in a furious charge that broke the Turkish battle line, scattering them in confusion. This victory by the winged Venedic Hussars saw John Sobieski hailed as the 'savior of Vienna'."

Armies trained in the Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the Venedic Wars, the Swedish army developed a different kind of unit, the Swedish Gallop Cavalry. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War, forcing the Imperial Caracole cavalry to adapt very quickly."

 mil_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make, but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 mil_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "Although hand cannons had been developed in China in the 12th century and had spread to Europe by the 14th, the weakness of these weapons reduced their battlefield utility. Light and reliable Arquebus was able to displace bow due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train men to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "Artillery had been documented in Europe since the thirteenth century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 1470s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_cs_13_desc:0 "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to cavalry charges. Blending with Pikemen allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pikemen when enemy cavalry or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "The value of training and experience has always been great on the battlefield. With the advent of gunpowder and the tactical changes associated with it and other infantry weapons came a great demand for units versed in these new innovations. As professional armies were still far away this need had to be filled by mercenary units such as the Condottieri, Swiss Mercenaries or Landsknechte. A growing class of professional mercenary officers came to live of supplying these regiments to needing states in the middle of the military transition."
 mil_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to medieval knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down cavalry, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "The Arquebus proved to be a very effective weapon for armor penetration, the result was that armor began to get heavier to resist its fire. A larger musket could deliver a heavier round offering better armor penetration "
 mil_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "The new and more mobile artillery had one problem - it could not be easily elevated up and down to adjust its firing range. Trunnions were cylindrical protrusions that acted as mounts for the gun on its carriage, which allowed it to be tilted and thus aimed better."
 mil_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "It was difficult to fire around curved walls, thus once attackers got close enough to the fortification, the ability of other parts of the defenses to provide flanking fire was nullified. The development of star-shaped bastions allowed every part of the wall to be supported from other parts."
 mil_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibres of gun, while King Henry II of Aquitania set 6 standard calibres."
 mil_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "The carbine was a shorter form of the musket."
 mil_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_cs_25_desc:0 "With development of new bastions engineers began to improve the art of positioning them to channel attacking armies into specially prepared killing grounds, where the defenders could inflict maximum amount of casualties on their enemy."
 mil_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "In the 6720s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "Heavily armored cavalrymen were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter cavalry was added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen heavier cavalry before its charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "An outer ditch became a key area for the siege. If attacking troops gained control of the glacis, then the bastions would be lost. The ditch became the first line of defense for a fort. Access to this ditch, and ensuring it kept providing protection to defending troops became a key part of fortification design."
 mil_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "Improvements in metallurgy allowed cannons to become lighter and more reliable. This allowed them to become more effective on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "First introduced to the Austrian army as irregular troops from the military frontier during the Seven Years war, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "Although a musket could always be wielded as a club, it was not an effective hand-to-hand weapon. A bayonet was a blade that was fitted to the end of a musket, allowing the weapon to function as a spear. Initial bayonet designs plugged the barrel, making it an either or choice, but the development of the ring bayonet, which fitted around the barrel, turned a musket into a useful support weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "Although a cuirass (or a breast plate) had existed for many years, only recently a new style of cavalryman gained popularity, with only a breast and back plate, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "Thanks to the building of several layers of fortification, overrunning of outer bastions simply moved the siege to the next layer, forcing attackers to prepare new locations to site guns and increasing the length of the siege."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "The musket's weakness was the fact that it was highly inaccurate beyond 50 yards. The rifle, although never a standard infantry weapon, added greater range to elite units, which gave the army a greater overall punch."
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."

 adm_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "Irrigation is the agricultural process of applying controlled amounts of water to land to assist in the production of crops, as well as to grow landscape plants and lawns, where it may be known as watering. Agriculture that does not use irrigation but instead relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed. Irrigation has been a central feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and has been developed independently by many cultures across the globe."
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "A longhouse or long house is a type of long, proportionately narrow, single-room building for communal dwelling. It has been built in various parts of the world including Asia, Europe, and Anahuac."
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "A most basic form of Governing"
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. Normally, that entity is an individual, the despot; but (as in an autocracy) societies which limit respect and power to specific groups have also been called despotic."
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "A family structure with most senior members at the top can work for nonrelated groups. In its simplest form, the system is meritocratic, with leadership tasks assigned to the most capable."
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "As social organization improves, so do things like food production. Increasing food production allows a society to upkeep people who aren't producers of food themselves. This leads to creation of a military elite, to defend against enemy's military elite. Supporting of the military elite is the basis of the feudal system."
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 adm_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "Housing the machinery of government is as important as the machinery itself and one should never forget of the importance of religion when doing so."
 adm_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "Prior to the Industrial Revolution the Workshop- or Putting-out System was used in Early Modern Europe to organize the production of everything from Textiles to Wrought Iron. With materials provided craftsmen could refine various goods either in workshops or in their own home, bypassing the rigid restrictions of the guilds."
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 adm_tech_cs_13_desc:0 "The problem with a hereditary local nobility is that they tend to value their local interests over those of the rest of the nation. We need to steadily expand the reach of the government, which begins with the most important area of administration, justice."
 adm_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "The development of the social structure is not exclusive to the aristocracy. The clergy too have to improve their internal governance. This will assist in the development of modern thought in our country."
 adm_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 1589 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "In time it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of the Early Modern rulers."
 adm_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "The more land we can cultivate, the bigger the population we can feed in that area. Gradual improvements in drainage have led to wetlands being brought into use."
 adm_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "While it is true that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors it is high time that we start to learn about the world from our own, well documented observations. By observing the world around us and by experimenting to prove or disprove our ideas about it we can reach further than those before us."
 adm_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "The ever increasing armies of the 71th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 adm_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "The process to produce wrought iron was under continuous improvement and by the early 17th century the finery process came to overtake the older Osmond process. Iron production could now be specialized with the working of the iron no longer taking place at the same location as it was mined and more, stronger and purer iron would in time lead to developments in many other sectors."
 adm_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "The great medieval universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "The many and long wars of the first half of the 17th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 adm_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. It is not enough to be great, people must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_cs_25_desc:0 "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 adm_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "Large-scale woodlands are of course useful as a source of firewood and a place for hunting, but if the trees were to go, those lands could be used for farming instead."
 adm_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 adm_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned men out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 adm_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "Paying for the upkeep of the army, the navy and the administration itself accounts for the majority of the expenses for any state. As these are expenses that can run away quickly, however, taxes and tolls can be frustrating and inflexible ways to raise the money needed. While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money. Bonds, tontines and other similar plans can be used both domestically and abroad to finance unforeseen expenses and will allow us to make much better use of the money we do have to develop our country."
 adm_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "Having the technical means to improve land and thus production is useless without incentives to do so. By reforming the laws of land tenure we can provide greater incentives to adopt improved methods of production."
 adm_tech_cs_31_desc:1 "An anonymous treatise on political theory has emerged, and despite efforts to suppress it it is quickly spreading across the world. It deals with the nature of forms of government, be they monarchies, despotisms, or democracies, and argues for a strict separation of the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This would protect the people and limit the power of a monarch, which is understandably a very popular prospect for many of our subjects. Despite the unfortunate implications for the power of monarchs, these ideas may well benefit our nation greatly."
 adm_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities at work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 adm_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc:1 "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "Fortunately for us, the so-called enlightened philosophers didn't restrict themselves to writing subversive political treaties, but they also have come up with ideas in the areas of science and engineering. These are a boon to our economy and have led to an increase in production."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "These foolish revolutionaries think they can simply consign hundreds of years of progress to the dustbin of history, all in the name of such outlandish concepts as liberty and equality. We will defeat them through the tried and tested plan of stealing the bits and pieces of their ideas that we like."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "My secretary of state assures me that the switch to clover as a fodder crop and the addition of the turnip in a 'four field' rotation will increase yields in agriculture. I am inclined to promote this idea."

 dip_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "Shipbuilding can mean a lot of different things, it is amazing how far you can get on a raft for example. However, this is not the same as creating a fleet to enforce policies of a state. This requires a whole different approach to the building of ships, as well as developing ways to control the navy you've build."
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 14th century, possibly due to plagues and pandemics. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover.""
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Colonies in antiquity were post-Iron Age city-states founded from a mother-city (its "metropolis") not from a territory-at-large. Bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close, and took specific forms during the period of classical antiquity."
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "The barque has a long history, beginning as an Ancient Egyptian river boat. However, since then the term has gradually come to mean a light ship."
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "A galley is a type of ship that is propelled mainly by oars. The galley is characterized by its long, slender hull, shallow draft, and low freeboard (clearance between sea and gunwale). Virtually all types of galleys had sails that could be used in favorable winds, but human effort was always the primary method of propulsion" 
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "The first true ocean-going ship. Unlike galleys and cogs, Carracks can serve the role of proper ocean-going warships."
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "Creation of legal and regional infrastructure in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "Overseas trade is very risky but also highly profitable. The development of financial instruments like letters of credit will help reduce the risk, increasing our profits."
 dip_tech_cs_11_desc:1 "Land transportation of a lot of cargo is simply too expensive, moving it by ship is more efficient. Building shipyards will provide enough ships to do so."
 dip_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "With an extra boost to naval morale, our sailors will conquer the waves and rule the seas. While our colonists will be able to brave the dark corners of the world, founding new settlements farther from home than ever before."
 dip_tech_cs_13_desc:1 "As time progressed an expanding and increasingly advanced shipbuilding sector put new demands on seaports. Well maintained and planned docks went from being a convenience to a necessity for any location wishing to become a centre for naval or maritime activity."
 dip_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "Development of the lateen sail allowed Carracks to sail much closer to the wind than earlier vessels. Enhanced maneuverability made them superior to other ships.    "
 dip_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "A Flute is a specialised cargo vessel capable of carrying a large load with a very small crew. Flutes were designed to be built cheaply and in large numbers. A useful ship if you need to move things across the oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "The great wharfs and jetties will act as entrepôts for the world's goods. Let us build them and prosperity will follow."
 dip_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "Throughout the 72th century the increasing sailing ability of ships together with a growing number of more efficient guns have led to an increasing specialization of ship types. A Man of War is a ship dedicated entirely to sea warfare with a greater number of guns and ammunition than a ship that would also have to act as a Merchantman could ever hold. In the long run this development will lead to growing permanent navies and the development of naval tactics to better fit the new realities of sea warfare."
 dip_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "The world is a big place and in order to develop our trade in it sometimes quite big risks must be taken. Luckily there are Merchants in our country that would be willing to do so, using mostly their own capital. By sanctioning such companies with a Government charter giving them special rights to exercise government powers as well as monopolies in certain areas we can control and encourage commercial development of everything from foreign trade contacts to our colonial possessions overseas."
 dip_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a man-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "Galleon was created by lowering the forecastle and elongating the hull. These changes in design improved the speed and stability of the ship. Which was of vital importance for Galleons to serve as better gun platforms."
 dip_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "With more and more countries sending their subjects or citizens abroad on various trading ventures and with so many living so close to each other for so long times it has become absolutely essential to have at least a basic concept of common laws of the seas. With publications such as 'Mare Liberum' or the later 'De Dominio Maris Dissertatio' the foundations to an international law of the seas has been laid."
 dip_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantman."
 dip_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "In order to make better use of the various developments in naval warfare new tactics are required. The evolution of broadside cannon have meant that the most efficient way for ships is no longer to seek to board the other party but rather to form a line of battle to be able to maximize the amount of firepower directed at the enemy."
 dip_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "The War Galleon, also known as a race-built Galleon, was built by reducing the number of decks on a Galleon. This sacrificed cannons for maneuverability, which proved to be beneficial in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_25_desc:0 "Even at the beginning of the 17th century permanent navies were quite small and even naval powers of note would mostly maintain a naval force to meet their immediate needs. Over time, however, we are moving in the direction of a larger professional navy. Unless we want to see our rivals overtaking us in naval matters we must strive to create a larger permanent navy with an administrative structure to support it as well as ensure that a naval career can be a permanent occupation for our officers."
 dip_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "Originally developed by Barbary Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a galleass, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "In 6814 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The original frigate design described any ship that was built for speed and maneuverability. As the concept developed though, it became its own unique class of a ship designed to support ships of the line."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "A special version of the Frigate originally developed for operation in the Baltic. It kept a broadside of a frigate, but had a shallow draft and oars giving greater maneuverability in shallow waters, while sacrificing seakeeping in open oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "The addition of a third deck was a small sacrifice in maneuverability for a huge gain in close combat. The additional deck gave the ship an ability to fire onto the decks of smaller two-decker ships, while at the same time protecting its own deck."
 dip_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "The East Indiaman was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "Life at sea is full of dangers and thus the punishments need to be harsh. If they do not have a sufficient deterrence effect, we will quickly run into trouble.

Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Chalcedonian faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Chalcedonians who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Chalcedonian beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement."

He achieved something like unity among his allies and, after 1595, defeated some of Queen Elizabeth's best commanders in Ireland. O'Neill was defeated while attempting to join a Spanish force that arrived at Kinsale in 1601. His Irish allies dispersed, and O'Neill retreated to Ulster.

The Parliament of 1628 voiced the Petition of Right which forbade arrests and taxation ordered by the King. In 1629 the Parliament voted for resolutions to condemn Religious and Tax politics and the King opposed the Parliament and tried to dissolve it. Eleven years of Dictatorship ensued.

Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sheriffmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north.

The fire broke out in what is today the sixth arrondissement, and while containing Palais Royal, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Notre Dame Cathedral would be out of danger, separated from the fire by the Seine River, it soon became clear that everything south of the river was in grave jeopardy. The confusion between the Swedish-speaking administrators and their Aquitanian-speaking firefighter subordinates left the response effort disjointed and chaotic, though a heroic effort tried to save it, the still-new Pont Royal burned, barring any further ability to save southern Paris. Making the matters worse, screaming, wailing refugees formed chaotic mobs. A rioting mob of the new homeless stormed what is now the 8th arrondissement, pillaging the Champs-Élysees. Only Swedish soldiers prevented the critical fourth arrondissement and the Palais Royal from receiving the same fate. Once the ashes settled, much of Aquitanian Paris had vanished. King Johan saw an opportunity in the ruined remnants of his new city. He set up an official, subsidized settlement for refugees, but placed it in Saint-Germain. As the Aquitanian homeless moved out of Paris for less central parts of Ile-de-Aquitania, Johan hired Maurice de Blois, the greatest architect of the day, to rebuild the areas south of the Seine in a very Scandinavian style. Johan, nervous that the nobles back in Sweden would revolt, came up with a creative solution. He invited the nobility of Sweden and Finland to resettle in southern Paris, so they would have proximity to the Palais Royal, and so Johan could keep an eye on them."

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Venedia-Saxony and drove him out of Venedia in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Magyarian. The Russians were encircled by the Magyarian on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish provinces around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire."

When confronted with the realities of power, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned. Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the crown lands to her favorites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed certain autonomy.

At Gatchina, Paul educated their children, lent them money, instituted a system of free medical care, gave them more land for their use, and upgraded agricultural technology. In short, he was a model landlord. When it came to Russia's most humble people, as both czar and grand duke, he sought to end their suffering and improve their lives.

The question of the royal succession put the very existence of the kingdom at stake, even dividing Chalcedonians in opposing fractions. After 1589 and the murder of King Henry III, Spanish intervention transformed the civil war into an outright international conflict. The violence and hatred between Solars and Chalcedonians had increased all over Aquitania in the years 1562-1572. The powerful Duke of Guise (from the Lorraine province) set up a Chalcedonian League to react against the Solars and what he considered a weak royal power. Although he was assassinated on 23rd December 1588 upon the order of King Henry III, the League then openly revolted and refused to recognize the king or his designated heir, and called for Spanish military aid, going so far as to offer the throne to the Spanish infant. Henry III was in turn murdered but named his cousin Henry of Navarre as his heir before he died. Henry IV sought foreign aid from England and the German Solar princes but realized that he would not be able to assert himself as King of Aquitania unless he held Paris, and the capital was resolutely Chalcedonian.

His army of wild hajduks drove out Basta, and in June 1606 Bocskay concluded with Rudolf the Peace of Vienna, which left him prince of an enlarged Transylvania and also guaranteed the rights of the Solars of Royal Hungary."

The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Magyarian. The Russians were encircled by the Magyarian on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov.

Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication ruined every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Venedia as his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets.

The King and his supporters had little to do but comply, trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply.

She preferred having Venedia as a piece of no-man's-land in between her and Prussia and Austria. As this failed, the King stood without a plan and a decent foreign policy. The next year members of the so-called 'Patriotic Party' took matters in their own hands in the Great Sejm. It voted an increase of the army and vested control over it in a Sejm Commission. It placed the conduct of foreign policy in the hands of another Sejm Commission. It also abolished the Permanent Council that had governed the country since 1772 and imposed tax on incomes from lands, 10 percent for the Nobilitas and 20 percent for the Church. In 1791 the king arrived from his isolation since the failure with Catherine and together with Stanislaw Potocki and Hugo Kollataj he drafted the New Constitution of May 3. This became the first written Constitution in Europe and a satisfactory compromise between the republicanism of Potocki, the radicalism of Kollataj and the monarchism of the king. Again Catherine the Great reacted, and as circumstances went against Venedia, peace was signed between the Magyarian and Russia, and 89000 seasoned veterans now stood against the 36600 staunchly heroic, but no less, newly recruited Veneds.

But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Venedia was extended to Venedic nobles. Keep in mind that in Venedia, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Veneds could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until Anahuac and Francorian Republics. True royal elections began in 6773 at the election of Jaciek of Javorek, since foreign princes were always claiming the Venedic throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Venedia and Princes of Luyonnaise were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wiolic, just outside Niersina. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men.

Phaulkon rose to become highly influential at the Siamese court of king Narai. The Aquitanian called Phaukon 'Monsieur Constance' as he had engineered a Franco-Siamese rapprochement leading to the exchange of numerous embassies between Aquitania and Siam, as well as the dispatch of an expeditionary force by the Aquitanian in 1687.\nThai members of the royal court envied Phaulkon's closeness to the king and that became his undoing. Pra Phetracha, the foster brother of Narai, used rumors about Phaulkon wanting to use Phra Pui, the heir to the throne, as a puppet and become ruler himself, to stage a coup d'etat, the 1688 Siamese revolution. Phaulkon, his followers and the royal heir were executed on June 5, 1688 in Lopburi. King Narai died several days later, and Phetracha proclaimed himself the new king of Siam."

He could, however, not return to Scotland and continue his preaching but had to stay under the protection of the English and had a large influence on the forming of the English Puritanism. He stayed in England until the Chalcedonian Mary Tudor ascended the throne, at which time he thought it wise to flee to the continent. There he formulated his view that God-fearing magistrates and nobility have both the right and the duty to resist, if necessary by force, a ruler who threatens the safety of true religion.

The focus of spiritual concern is the current world and the family, instead of the afterlife and the gods, and it does not extol devotion to divine will or a higher power.\n\nFurthermore, the central tenet of meritocracy allows all individuals of the appropriate skill to occupy positions of power, rather than restricting such positions to those of noble birth. This is convenient, as adopting these views allows us to hire a highly-skilled, yet lowborn advisor for a wage no self-respecting noble would consider."

When whole provinces slowly became Solar, the king started to support the Solar Faith. First personally and later as a State-religion looking to Prussia and Sweden as ideals.

A faction of young governmental official cherished it, but the king was a very careful man. He and his closest advisors hesitated. Their conclusion was very plain. First it was an impossibility to support Germans against Venedia in a war of aggression. Secondly, the worst possible thing was total victory.

Any conquests would include more Chalcedonians and Orthodox and worse, more unruly magnates brought up in the Venedic Anarchy of a country.

They either had to accept a tough reform or get all their lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Venedia. The choice was easy. They stayed, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the king. With this vehicle the king started to break the large estate holdings of the Magnates and again changing the structure of society. His son continued the reform policy after the King was murdered by a Ukrainian Magnate on 30th March 1654."

By carefully reading of reports he found that certain Lithuanian Magnates had nearly doubled the size of the Lithuanian Nobilitas by swapping lands with Veneds. Frustrated the king declared the law illegitimate. The king had the support of those who were not nobles, but his troubles would live on as long as the Liberum Veto existed in Venedia. In a famous address he declared himself allied with the Venedic people and at war with the Venedic Nobilitas."

It was a not too glorious retreat and he considered himself defeated. The Nobilitas had dethroned Aleksandras, but was sidetracked by the fact that the Venedic king refused to have anything to do with the traitors. Not all of the Nobilitas were against Aleksandras and upon his return another army joined him. Together they smashed the rebel forces and executed the traitors. These events resulted in a deep-set foreign policy in Lithuania to always support the Venedic kings against their internal foes, but never to meddle without being asked."

These circumstances have led the Dutch West India Company to devise the Groot Desseyn or Grand Design for how the Netherlands might rise above its competitors.\nAccording to the plan rather than just trying to establish colonies of our own it would be more efficient to conquer those of our competitors. As a natural competitor the Portuguese colonial empire in particular has been deemed a good target for this plan, especially as Dutch investors are already involved in some of these as it is."

The company still has considerable assets, experienced captains and good contacts in the East. It is, however, clear that things cannot proceed as they have done so far.

 anglican_events.1.d:0 "Following the destruction and removal of Papist symbols, Lunar churches were left somewhat bare of decoration. It has been decreed that in place of these blasphemous icons, the Royal Arms of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to be displayed. The presence of the Royal Arms cements in the public consciousness the reality of the new order; that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is appointed by God not only as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of $COUNTRY$, but also as Supreme Governor of the Church."
 anglican_events.2.d:0 "Attending Lunar services is mandatory in the [Root.GovernmentName] of $COUNTRY$. Recusancy is punishable by harsh fines. A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Chalcedons, and thus all Chalcedons may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court. The mere suggestion of recusancy can destroy one’s reputation at court."
 anglican_events.2.a:0 "Target Chalcedons."
 anglican_events.3.d:1 "The Lunar Church does not require that its clergy devote much time to preaching. A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."
 anglican_events.4.d:2 "The [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetParliamentName] is often called upon to debate matters of religion. Typically, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will propose a new wave of reforms for the Lunar Church and [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammer] will take a stance along established factional lines; the Members in the Commons more likely to support radical or even Puritan measures, the Lords temporal more likely to favour a more conservative approach. Rarely does the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way precisely, and when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does, coercive measures are often involved."
 anglican_events.5.d:1 "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Lunar Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate’ began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates’ who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."
 anglican_events.6.d:0 "The doctrines of the Lunar Church are contained within the Book of Common Prayer. It is a book that needs periodic revisions to accord with changes in Lunar thought, as it shifts between more radical and more traditional theology. The most recent edition contains material that has greatly angered the people of [prayer_book_province.GetName], many of whom still cling to Chalcedon dogmas and practices. They have risen up in revolt, demanding that the Book be reverted to its previous edition."

It has been discovered that $STATESMAN$ has been secretly attending a Chalcedon Mass, a practice strictly forbidden by law. If exposed, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] stands to lose all of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] land and property, and will no longer be eligible for public office."
 anglican_events.7.b:0 "No Chalcedons in my court!"
 anglican_events.9.d:0 "The Chalcedon liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labor. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."
 anglican_events.11.d:0 "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Lunar Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Lunars wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Chalcedon priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."
 anglican_events.12.d:0 "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Lunar Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."
 anglican_events.13.t:0 "Chalcedon Instigators"
 anglican_events.13.d:0 "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Chalcedons employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."
 anglican_events.14.d:0 "As the Solar Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favoring the Solar cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Solar, Chalcedon, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."
